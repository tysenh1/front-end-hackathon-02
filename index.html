        <p>The McDonald's brothers opened their first restaurant on May 15, 1940, in San Bernardino, California. Initially, they served barbecue using a carhop drive-in system. By 1948, they realized hamburgers were their top seller. They closed the original drive-in and introduced a streamlined menu featuring only hamburgers, cheeseburgers, potato chips, coffee, ice cream, soft drinks, and apple pie.</p>
        <p>In 1954, at the age of 52, Ray Kroc invested his life savings to become the exclusive distributor of the Multimixer, a milkshake maker. He learned that a McDonald's stand in California, owned by Dick and Mac McDonald, was using eight Multimixers simultaneously. Intrigued, Kroc traveled to California to see it for himself.</p>
        <p>He was amazed by how efficiently they served so many customers with a limited menu, ensuring quality at every step. Inspired by this model, Kroc suggested opening more restaurants. When the McDonald brothers asked who would take charge, Kroc replied, "What about me?"</p>
