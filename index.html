        <h3>History of the Big Mac</h3>
        <p>The McDonalds Big Mac originally came out in August of 1968 to feed steel mill workers as the original single patty cheeseburger wasn't filling enough.</p>
        <p>The original Special Sauce for the burger started out as "Secret Sauce" and was actually 2 different sauces that both performed well. 
            The two sauces were combined in 1972 and renamed to "Big Mac Sauce '72". The sauce was then renamed to Special Sauce in 1974. The recipe was changed in 1991 before the original recipe was reinstated in 2004.</p>
